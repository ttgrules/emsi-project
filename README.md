#John Hunt's Interview Project for Emsi
This project uses a sample Emsi api call to render a report page. It is written in react, with Chart.js for charts and react-bootstrap as it's css-framework.

#Setup
This project requires Node.js to build properly

```
npm install && npm start
```

Should install all required modules and start a preview version at localhost:3000

If you would rather skip that, check out a running version at [https://emsi.ttgrules.com](https://emsi.ttgrules.com)
